### System Requirements

## Sites Using 4Dpubs

Single-source is one advantage of 4Dpubs. Because the source is DITA, you can publish 
that source in any other format that DITA supports. The 4D content displays dynamically 
in the app, and you can generate static publications for viewing outside of the app.
Turbonomic uses 4Dpubs to dynamically deliver help and API documentation. To see this 
in action, install the Turbonomic product. You also can see static versions 
of this documentation:
